# Enable Users to Learn in the Flow of Work

## Learning Objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
- Explain the benefits of customizing the Help Menu and Learning Paths.
- Customize Learning Paths for your org.


Bringing training and learning resources into the Salesforce app ensures help is always right at your users’ fingertips. Even if you have an internal wiki or shared folders, quick links inside the app mean your users spend less time digging around for answers. Salesforce offers a bunch of ways to bring custom help and guidance inside the app. Let’s focus on two ways of offering onboarding for users just starting out and troubleshooting for more experienced users.

## Learning Paths
Salesforce Learning Paths bring the power of learning directly into the app, enabling companies to skill up teams as they work in Salesforce. With Learning Paths, companies of any size and industry equip their employees with just-in-time, personalized learning in the flow of work and employees of all experience levels enhance their skills and increase their productivity. 

Provide teams with the skills they need to do their best work by adding Trailhead and myTrailhead modules or linking out to resources such as a wiki or video. Then assign the content to the entire organization or specific users and teams, or on the pages they interact with most. For admins that want to save time maintaining training for their users but stay organized and current, Learning Paths offer a lightweight but customizable solution.

## Help Menu
The Help Menu provides a few key resources that your users can access from anywhere. When users click the question mark in the header, a dropdown menu appears with contextual help chosen by Salesforce. You can add a global custom section with links to up to 30 resources of your own. Unlike Learning Paths, the same resources are shown everywhere in the app.

## Try It Out

**Want to Get Hands-on with Learning Paths?**

In this module, we show you the steps to create learning items in Learning Paths. We don’t have any hands-on challenges in this module, but if you want to follow along and try out the steps, here’s how to launch your Trailhead Playground. First, make sure you're logged in to Trailhead. Then click your user avatar in the upper-right corner of this page and select **Hands-on Orgs** from the dropdown. Click **Launch** next to the org you want to open. Or, if you want to create a new playground, click **Create Playground**.

1. To open the panel, click the icon for Learning Paths in the global header. A learning panel opens.
2. At the bottom of the panel, click **Go to Learning Home**.
3. On Learning Home, go to the Manage Learning Assignments tab, then click **New**.
4. Choose the following options in the form and save.
   1. Trailhead Module: Trailhead: Quick Look
   2. Location App: All
   3. Location Objects and Records: All
   4. Assignments: Assign to all users

For each scenario, fill out the form with these details. Save the new learning items. 

**Want to learn more about the Help Menu?**

It’s simple and quick to add your own custom section to the Help Menu so it appears on all pages throughout the app. See the Resources section for the specific instructions. 

## Choosing the Right Content
The possibilities for in-app learning moments are endless. Here are just a few ideas from the Salesforce community.

- Onboarding or training wiki
- FAQ about using Salesforce or working with customers
- Price sheet or product list
- Company dictionary or glossary
- Support guide
- A Trailhead trailmix
- myTrailhead

Think of all the time you save by preventing emails from users asking similar, easy-to-answer questions. Instead, spend a small amount of time to customize the Help Menu and empower users to find the information themselves.

Here are some tips when selecting your own learning items for users.

- Choose shorter resources for learning items to keep the learning bite-size and optimize your user's attention span. The time to complete should be under a half hour.
- Assign only one or two contextual learning items per page to avoid overwhelming the user when opening the panel for help.
- Use due dates to give users an idea of when to complete the learning.
- Make help and troubleshooting content accessible, clear, and empathetic. A good help experience acknowledges that a user may feel lost or frustrated, but always offers options for solutions while maintaining a confident and optimistic tone.
